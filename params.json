The site was built in 2007. Its expressionengine 1.6 technology and design are outdated and need to be ported, upgraded to wordpress 4.1\r\n\r\n> All members can contribute by posting, editing, tagging, voting, linking and commenting articles. \r\n\r\n> All contributors automatically share in the earnings (ad income, donations, sponsoring), proportionally to their contributions. This is done using the HTTPS://MOBBR.COM payment system. \r\n\r\n> Articles are selected for frontpage display by an algorithm that adaptively weighs votes, comments, commenters, views, referers etc.\r\n\r\n> **Modern news reporting doesn't fit a standard blog format, Zaplog introduces the revolutionary news stream or event timeline for this.**\r\n\r\n###Milestones\r\n\r\n- The first milestone will be the MVP or <a href=\"https://github.com/patricksavalle/zaplog-wordpress-plugin/milestones/Minimum%20viable%20product\">minimum viable product</a>. \r\n- The second milestone will be the revolutionary <a href=\"https://github.com/patricksavalle/zaplog-wordpress-plugin/milestones/Event%20timelines\">event timeline</a> or newsstream.\r\n- The third milestone will be the <a href=\"https://github.com/patricksavalle/zaplog-wordpress-plugin/milestones/RSS%20aggregator\">collaborative content aggregator</a>.\r\n\r\n##Development and contributions\r\n\r\nEveryone is invited to contribute. The crowdfunded amount will be divided among all contributors proportional to their contributions using HTTPS://MOBBR.COM (as soon as the milestones and issues are closed).\r\n\r\n<b>By contributing you accept that rewards are divided by an algorithm that might or might not be completely 'fair'.</b>\r\n\r\nPlease announce your activities and progress in the comments of the issues.\r\n\r\n###Re-use\r\n\r\nWhere possible use and integrate existing open-source code (check license!), if this is done using GITHUB repos, the original contributors will share in the rewards.\r\n\r\n###Recommended Tools\r\n\r\nThe plugin uses a variable to store the text domain used when internationalizing strings. To take advantage of this method, there are tools that are recommended for providing correct, translatable files:\r\n\r\n* [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/)\r\n* [makepot](http://i18n.svn.wordpress.org/tools/trunk/)\r\n* [i18n](https://github.com/grappler/i18n)\r\n\r\n### Includes\r\n\r\nNote that if you include your own classes, or third-party libraries, there are three locations in which files may go:\r\n\r\n* `zaplog-wordpress-plugin/includes` is where functionality shared between the dashboard and the public-facing parts of the side reside\r\n* `zaplog-wordpress-plugin/admin` is for all dashboard-specific functionality\r\n* `zaplog-wordpress-plugin/public` is for all public-facing functionality\r\n\r\n### Assets\r\n\r\nThe `assets` directory contains three files.\r\n\r\n1. `banner-772x250.png` is used to represent the plugin’s header image.\r\n2. `icon-256x256.png` is a used to represent the plugin’s icon image (which is new as of WordPress 4.0).\r\n3. `screenshot-1.png` is used to represent a single screenshot of the plugin that corresponds to the “Screenshots” heading in your plugin `README.txt`.\r\n\r\nThe directory structure contains three directories:\r\n\r\n1. `assets`\r\n2. `trunk`\r\n\r\nWhen committing code to the repository, all of the banner, icon, and screenshot should be placed in the `assets` directory of the repository, and the core code should be placed in the `trunk` directory.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nThe plugin is licensed under the <a href=\"https://github.com/patricksavalle/zaplog-wordpress-plugin/blob/master/zaplog/trunk/LICENSE.txt\">GPL v2 or later</a>.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### On Linux or OS X\r\n\r\n1.
