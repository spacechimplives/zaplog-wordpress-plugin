#Overview

The zaplog plugin delivers functionality based on the succesful zaplog social news site. The site was built in 2007. Its expressionengine 1.6 technology and design are outdated and need to be ported, upgraded to wordpress 4.1

Any member can post or link dump articles. Posts are eligable for frontpage display based on an algorithm that adaptively weighs votes, comments, commenters, views, etc. 

Members can earn participation points based on wich rewards (payback from ad income, donations) are distributed. This is done using the MOBBR.COM payment system.

All functionality will be contained in a single plugin.

The first milestone will be the <a href="https://github.com/patricksavalle/zaplog-wordpress-plugin/milestones/Minimum%20viable%20product">Minimum Viable Product</a>. The second milestone will be building a social RSS aggregator.

##Basic wordpress layout

We are going to setup a multi-site wordpress installation in which each user automatically gets his own blog on his own subdomain. The posts and discussion across all blogs are aggregated onto main pages. The blogs can be multi-author. Members are shared across al subsites.

##Development and rewarding

Anyone is invited to participate.

This GITHUB will be funded using Mobbr. As soon as the milestones and issues are closed, are pledges are divided among all contributors based on their participation.

Where possible we will use and integrate existing open-source plugins, if this is done using GITHUB repos, the original contributors will share in the rewards.
